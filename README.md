üéµ LLM-Powered Music Recommendation System
Discover songs tailored to your mood using hybrid embeddings (text + audio features)!

üìå Overview: 

This project uses categorized audio features (e.g., "high-energy", "low-acousticness") embedded into a structured text template, combined with sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2 embeddings, to build a music recommender.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

    - Natural Language Feature Encoding: Numerical features (BPM, Energy, etc.) are converted to descriptive categories (e.g., "fast tempo") and injected into a text template.

    - Textualized Audio Features

    - FAISS Indexing: Efficient similarity search for real-time recommendations.

    - Semantic Search: LLM embeddings understand nuanced queries (e.g., "upbeat workout songs with low acousticness").


üìÇ Dataset: Top50MusicFrom2010-2019 from Spotify.

‚úíÔ∏è template = 

        "a {popularity_cat} and {loudness_cat} {speechiness_cat} music titled: {title}, by : {artist} released in : {year}, {genre} Genre {tempo_cat} Tempo, {energy_cat} Energy and {dancability_cat} Dancability . it has {liveness} Liveness and {valence_cat} Mood. {length_cat} Length and {acousticness_cat} acousticness"
    

Feature Injected Template Example : 

        "A very popular and loud speech-heavy music titled: 'Blinding Lights', by: The Weeknd released in: 2020, Pop Genre with fast tempo, high energy, and very danceable. It has studio-like liveness and happy mood. Average length and low acousticness."


üß† How It Works
Feature Categorization:

        Numerical features (e.g., Energy=0.8) ‚Üí descriptive labels ("high energy").

Text Template Injection:

        Labels are inserted into a structured template to create a natural language description.

LLM Embedding:

        all-mpnet-base-v2 converts descriptions into embeddings.

FAISS Search:

        Queries are embedded and matched against the index.


üìä Why This Approach?
LLM-Friendly: Text descriptions allow the model to understand audio features semantically.

Interpretable: Categories (e.g., "high energy") are more intuitive than raw numbers for users.

Example Usage : 
search("a music about Drugs and in genre of hip hop", index_all, texts_artist_genre_year, 10)
